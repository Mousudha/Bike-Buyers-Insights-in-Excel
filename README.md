Interactive Visualizations: Charts galore! Discover compelling insights through our interactive charts. From clustered columns showing average income per purchase by gender, to line charts depicting age brackets and commute distances against bike purchases, there's plenty to explore.

Slicers for Personalized Analysis: Want to focus on specific demographics? We've got you covered with slicers for marital status, region, and education. Personalize your analysis to uncover the insights that matter most to you.
